A simple Java console application demonstrating object-oriented programming, inheritance, and polymorphism.  The program defines an abstract Product class with fields for articleNumber, title, price, and description, and an abstract method category().

Here’s what this project helped me truly understand:

🧩 Abstraction
Designing a base Product class with shared fields like articleNumber, title, price, and description taught me to focus on what objects have in common.

🧩 Inheritance
Creating different product types that extend Product showed me the power of reusing structure while allowing each class to have its own unique behavior.

🧩 Polymorphism
Implementing the category() method differently in each product type was the moment it clicked: same method, different behavior, clean and flexible design.

Even though this started as a school project, it became one of those builds that truly strengthened my understanding of Java fundamentals.

Sometimes the “simple” projects are the ones that level you up the most.
